# GMail-Organize-Assist

This 'GMail-Organize-Assist' repository contains scripts for organizing your GMail account. They are by no means a package. Each can be run independently.

To get started, go to https://script.google.com. Create a new script. Copy and paste the desired code into the workarea. If you'd like, 
you can add a trigger at the project's menu.

Each file should have a description for use.
